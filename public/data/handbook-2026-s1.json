        "This subject was formerly known as Construction Analysis.",
        "This subject explores the idea of construction as a process that strategically links structural principles to building elements, systems, materials, and techniques. The subject also covers key elements of building services and sustainability, including strategies to achieve internal comfort (related to building orientation, envelope, heating and cooling, air quality, acoustics, water and waste). Using a set of given case studies, students are asked to review and describe the physical anatomy of Australian residential buildings, emphasising how architectural ideas are conventionally translated into sustainable technological solutions. Students are asked to calculate how buildings perform, therefore understanding their impact on the environment.",

        "Cities remain the dominant form of civilization in the 21st century, and they are locations where humanity’s struggle for survival takes place. With more than half of the world’s population now living in cities, they are the world’s engine of growth. As the economist Ed Glaeser puts it, “we are an urban species,” and there are no signs of any slowdown in the growth of cities. Global cities play an increasingly important role at the global and regional level: From Asia to Africa, from South and North America to Europe, large cities enjoy significant competitive advantages and serve as primary nodes in the globalized economic system. They interact with states and other international actors, pursue objectives that are often intertwined with global economic agendas, and are crucial to questions related to climate change, mobility and migration, technological innovation, economic development and infrastructure.",
        "But what makes cities so incredibly important is not just population or economics stats. Cities are humanity’s most realistic hope for future democracy to thrive, from the grassroots to the global. Cities are places where people can see opportunities for a better and more prosperous life, but also dramatically display the challenges posed by social inequalities and exclusion.",
        "This subject inquires: why do governments plan for cities and regions? What is the role of the private sector and civil society (individuals and community organizations) in planning? What kind of issues does planning respond to and what are the concepts, strategies, tools, and ethics involved in that planning response? Why do planning decisions make some people so angry? In short, why does planning matter in cities?",
        "This subject moves from the local scale (neighbourhood planning issues) to the metropolitan (planning issues in my city-region) and international (planning issues in a global context) scales, in order to examine central issues and processes affecting planning systems worldwide, drawing on case studies from Australia, and countries in Asia and Africa. The subject is designed to provide an introductory understanding of key concepts and critical drivers of city development across scales and their relation to planning processes and outcomes.",
        "Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject students should be able to:Communicate their informed opinions on contemporary planning issues and principles in Australia and internationally, trends on these issues, and reasons for these trends;Evaluate and communicate indigenous and innovative approaches to city development;Assess and understand the drivers of city development, and hierarchical structure of city functionality;Analyze and contribute to current planning debates and related arguments on these issues and the reasons for trends and projections, and the various value positions;Develop and evaluate solutions to identified urban problems;Develop communication skills through independent research, essays, posters, and oral presentations.",

        "What does nineteenth-century European art tell us about the society that made it and our world today? Radical social and cultural changes marked this period. Political upheavals, rapid industrialisation and urbanisation, a second scientific revolution, and the aggressive expansion of European imperial powers in Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Caribbean reshaped society’s attitudes towards class, race, gender, nature, bodies, senses and emotions. These shifts have left a lasting impact that still reverberates today. Artists responded to these changes in multiple ways, defying the traditional approaches of the academy and creating new modes of representing the world. From Romanticism and Orientalism to Impressionism and the avantgardes of the late nineteenth century, artists’ shifting representations of social relations, the landscape, the human body, and sexual and gender identity fundamentally altered both the function of visual art and the role of the artist.",

To ground these theoretical critiques, we draw on ethnographic examples from across the world.",

The Earth’s surface is shaped by a complex interaction of physical and biological processes operating over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding these processes in the present day, as well as reconstructing landscape and ecological change in the past, enables us to predict their future response to climate change and human activity. In this subject, students will study the processes and spatial patterns that shape natural landscapes and learn about approaches of reconstructing their evolution. Students will gain an appreciation of the ways that the dynamics of natural landscapes need to be incorporated into environmental management and the conservation of biodiversity.",

In addition, the subject addresses the geographic patterns and dynamics of life on the Earth’s surface and investigates the way in which certain landscapes support particular types of ecosystems (such as rainforest, grassland, desert, estuarine and marine communities).

Although most of us know of China’s swift rise from communist to ‘Red Capitalist’ state, western discourse continues to approach China monolithically and from the outside, reflecting western preoccupations and anxieties with great conflicts over power and geopolitics, but giving little thought to how everyday Chinese people think and feel about their rapidly changing worlds. This subject explores how China’s massive social, economic, environmental, and political transformations are being lived from within the world’s most populous nation, centring the Chinese experience and grounding its approach in the spaces and places of a diverse nation. You will gain the ability to speak intelligently on a range of topics integral to explaining China’s rise, position, and future, with a sensitivity to geographical differentiation.

The beaches, dunes, estuaries and rocky cliffs that comprise the coast are some of the most intensively utilised landscapes worldwide and Australia is no exception. Population growth, development, and climate change are pushing natural functioning systems to the brink. However, intense human impact is only a relatively recent phenomenon. Coastal landforms operate over much longer timescales than people. Beaches and dunes have natural cycles of erosion and deposition over decadal to centennial scales while cliff erosion may relate to a history developed over several hundred thousand years. It is therefore impossible to successfully manage, or simply enjoy this environment, without knowledge of how it evolved and operates. During this subject we will explore the operation and management of the key landforms found at the shore. The drivers of change on the coast, from waves and sea level to weathering and sediment, will all be analysed. The key management strategies from seawalls to nature-based infrastructure will be discussed and critiqued. Only through a thorough understanding how landforms operate can our coasts be managed for current and future generations. This subject will equip you with the skills and knowledge fundamental for a successful career in the public, private and not-for-profit environmental sectors.",

Sustainable development has become a chameleon, suiting different needs and fulfilling different roles for different people with different interests. In this subject, we will explore this appealing-yet-slippery idea with the aim of deciding whether it is a suitable concept with which to explore the cultural, environmental, and economic challenges facing society. Is sustainable development a useful idea, do we need to move on, or can we take it back?",
        "In addition to the debates over sustainable development, this subject will provide students with the skills needed to examine, analyse, and report on challenges related to their interests. At its heart, the subject explores the primary question of sustainable development, which is whether it can be useful in a world (seemingly) approaching numerous catastrophic tipping points. The climate is changing, the oceans are acidifying, the soils cannot keep producing our food, and wealth is being concentrated amongst a smaller and smaller segment of the world. Is sustainable development helpful in understanding, and ideally changing, these trends?",
        "There are also more practical considerations surrounding the debate over sustainable development. Some people might be interested in having a greater impact on the world through development projects, micro-credit, or volunteering. Is sustainable development helpful? Can the concept help individuals seeking to improve our world (or at least trying)? Does it help ensure that their efforts are beneficial and not perverted by opposing interests and processes?",
        "It is also worth considering whether sustainable development might not be better thought of as an analytical framing: as a way of pulling apart problems or projects in order to better understand or assess their impact on ecological sustainability, development, or economics? Is sustainable development an analytical tool for making sense of ‘wicked’ problems?",
        "In this subject we will review the history of sustainable development, which draws together literature from Geography, Sociology, Engineering, Psychology, Economics, and the Sciences. We will explore critiques of sustainable development, and force ourselves to consider whether it is possible, practical, or even useful in the ‘real world’. We will explore several key challenges, using sustainable development as a lens or framing.

        "The American Revolution promised to forge a new Republic founded on the radical idea that all men were created equal. Yet, the founding of the United States cemented racial slavery in its economic and social systems, and slavery grew dramatically within the young nation in the nineteenth century. This subject examines the historical significance of these tensions between the promise of freedom and the subordination of certain groups within American society from the Revolution through to 1945, when the US emerged as a major world power. The subject explores the consequences of the existence of slavery in a free society, including the fighting of a terrible civil war. It also considers the nineteenth-century movements of enslaved and free Black people, women’s rights advocates, and Native Americans, to expand the circle of full citizenship. The dynamics and consequences of growth is the second major theme: topics include the emergence of a market economy, the frontier and the fate of indigenous Americans during the decades of westward expansion. Finally, the subject traces the emergence of an internationally influential modern mass society and culture in the early twentieth century – topics here include Prohibition, the Great Depression and New Deal, film and broadcasting, the segregated South, immigration, and the two world wars. Here again we examine the tensions between the promises of new freedoms and the constraints facing particular groups in American society. The subject blends social, cultural and political history, attending to the histories of ordinary people, leaders of social and political movements, and presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.",

Is ‘sexuality’ strictly a modern concept or can it also be applied to past societies? In this subject we look at modern and pre-modern conceptions of sex and sexuality to show how our ideas about something as ubiquitous as sex are actually historically constructed. We examine the role of religion in forming ideas about sex, the relationship between sex and sin, and the evolution of these ideas over several centuries. We take categories such as homosexual, heterosexual, intersex and transgender and ask if and how these categories can apply to historical case studies. We look at how certain individuals were able to defy gender norms and the ways in which different societies enforced social and sexual control. On completion of the subject, students should understand the ways in which sex and sexualities have multiple histories and how they remain highly contested even today.",

        "The years of Joseph Stalin’s rule (1928-1953) were the most violent in Soviet history. They have inspired one of the most controversial, varied and interesting discussions in the history of the twentieth century. Did 'Stalinism' form a system in its own right or was it a mere stage in the overall development of Soviet society? Was it an aberration from Leninism or the logical conclusion of Marxism? Was its violence the revenge of the Russian past or the result of a revolutionary mindset? Was Stalinism the work of a madman or the product of social forces beyond his control? Could it have been avoided? Could the Soviets have won the Second World War without Stalin’s ‘Revolution from Above’? What was it like to live under Stalin? What did we learn from the opening of the archives after the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991?",
        "This seminar-based subject explores the answers historians and other social scientists have given to these questions. It analyses the political, moral, and emotional undercurrents of these debates. It introduces students not only to the state of historical research on the Stalin years, but also to the history of contemporary debates on Stalinism. This subject is part of the suggested pathway ‘political and international history’ which majors may follow, if they have a special interest in political and international history.

        "In an increasingly globalised world it is impossible to imagine any state including Indonesia being completely disengaged from the rest of the world. Indonesia's constant global engagement is evidence of its geopolitical importance on the international stage. Indonesia is a unitary state built out of culturally and historically diverse components, and its diversity is the potential for dialogue with other nation-states. In this subject, students will examine the interaction dynamics between Indonesia and the world from a range of perspectives such as language and culture, politics, education, commerce, and entertainment. There are two main themes that will be discussed in a complementary manner namely nationalism and internationalism. Indonesia's colonial past and its post-colonial experience, as well as the symbols and the pragmatic social-political processes for building national cohesion and international relations, will be explored in order to comprehend the extent of mutual influences between Indonesia and the world. This subject is conducted in Indonesian.",

Students will study the origins of the Qur'an, its overall structure and content, major themes, approaches to its interpretation, and its function in Muslim religious, social, cultural and political life. The first part of the subject lays the groundwork by situating the Qur’an within the religious landscape of late antiquity Arabia and the life of Prophet Muhammad. Students analyse the distinctive qualities of the Qur’an’s language and style, consider the differences between Meccan and Medinan periods, and explore the thematic shifts addressing the maturing Muslim community of believers and the struggle against their opponents. A major focus is the Qur’an’s teachings on core theological issues like God’s nature, creation, humanity's role and responsibilities, and eschatology. Legal and ethical precepts governing personal, family, social and political life are covered in detail, including Qur’anic perspectives on gender. The subject examines both classical and modern approaches to Qur’anic exegesis (tafsir), including reason-based, tradition based, mystical, and feminist interpretations. Contemporary academic debates surrounding the Qur’an are also discussed. Overall, the subject provides a holistic understanding of the Qur'an as a scripture, an artefact, a philosophy, a moral guide and students will be better equipped to engage with the Qur’an’s significance and place within the world of Islam.",

Compactness of the unit interval is established and various consequences of compactness, such as the Extreme Value Theorem, are discussed. A similar treatment of continuity and differentiability of functions of a single variable leads to applications such as the Mean Value Theorem and Taylor’s theorem. We define the Riemann integral and explore its properties, and we prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The convergence properties of sequences and series are explored, with applications to power series representations of elementary functions and their generation by Taylor series.

        "The world has fundamentally changed with the rise of generative AI. In the last few years, powerful large language models (LLMs) have shown themselves capable of doing things that we had previously assumed only human beings could do: use language fluently, create compelling images, and even write music. So impressive are these systems that some AI engineers have proclaimed them to be conscious. A fierce debate has erupted in the public sphere about what it would take for consciousness to emerge within a machine, and whether this is in fact what has happened.",
        "In this way, the advent of generative AI raises with increasing urgency some ancient philosophical questions about the nature of the mind. Are human beings really just sophisticated physical machines with conscious minds? If so, could an LLM (which is after all just another kind of sophisticated physical machine) have a conscious mind? If not, why not? Given that having a mind endows us with all sorts of mental capacities – we can dream, feel, imagine, know right from wrong – is it reasonable to think that an AI could do all these things, too? Is it possible for our minds to outlive our bodies? Might future technology make death optional – and if it could, would this be a good thing? And what effects are today’s technologies having on our minds right now?",

        "Just about any problem in the world is frequently blamed on capitalism: inequality, wage stagnation, consumerism, climate change, precarious work, unemployment, high rent and latte prices – you name it! Capitalism has a clear image problem, but is it really the root of all evil? And what is capitalism anyway?",
        "In this subject, we’ll start by taking a look at major figures of liberal political philosophy (Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill), and their defence of capitalism as a route to a more just and efficient society. This approach will lead us to challenge the familiar conflation of capitalism with unadulterated laissez faire economics, and reconsider the extent to which current societies really are purely capitalist.",
        "With a theory of why capitalism can be a force for the good in hand, and turning our attention to contemporary authors, we’ll be able to come to a more sophisticated perspective on what’s wrong with central economic aspects of contemporary society and what ought to be done about them. We’ll ask whether it’s fair for the Australian government to force people to take jobs they don’t want while others inherit larger fortunes tax-free, whether employers have power over workers akin to authoritarian dictators, whether it should be illegal to sell human organs to save lives, and what role the assessment of capitalism should have in coming to terms with the history of colonialism in Australia and elsewhere. Last but not least, we’ll examine the role of markets in generating and distributing the coronavirus vaccine we desperately need, and what ought to be done to address the economic consequences of the pandemic.",

        "A key challenge for urban planning is to develop and assess a range of possible future scenarios that can confirm, question, and sometimes challenge ongoing processes and trends. Scenario planning provides planners a framework to make non-emergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets, and forecasts, and painting a clearer picture of key drivers for urban development and growth, and the potential impact of future planning decisions or development problems (e.g., climate change).",
        "In doing so, scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling planners and decision makers to react quickly and decisively — because a situation has been thought through and actions documented, no one must scramble when during a crisis. Thus, scenario planning aims to define planning’s critical uncertainties and develop plausible scenarios (situations) in order to discuss the impacts and the responses to give for each one of them. If planners are aware of what could happen, they are more likely to deal with what will happen. So, how can planners use scenario planning to help to make planning decisions agile and able to adapt to multiple eventualities?",
